### Removing "Powered by"

#### Email
For email layout copy the whole  mail folder from [`/protected/humhub/views/mail`](https://github.com/humhub/humhub/tree/master/protected/humhub/views/mail) and on [line 697](https://github.com/humhub/humhub/blob/master/protected/humhub/views/mail/layouts/html.php#L697) remove what you're looking for (Note : You'll have to remove it from [line 10](https://github.com/humhub/humhub/blob/master/protected/humhub/views/mail/layouts/text.php#L10) in `text.php` as well) Once you done this please move the whole folder into `/YOUR-HUMHUB/themes/YOURTHEME/views`

#### Login/Sign Up
For this you do the same thing you did above, copy [`/protected/humhub/modules/user/views/layouts`](https://github.com/humhub/humhub/blob/master/protected/humhub/modules/user/views/layouts/main.php) (The whole folder!) edit and remove [line 27](https://github.com/humhub/humhub/blob/master/protected/humhub/modules/user/views/layouts/main.php#L27), once that is done place the whole user folder into `/YOUR-HUMHUB/themes/YOURTHEME/views`
